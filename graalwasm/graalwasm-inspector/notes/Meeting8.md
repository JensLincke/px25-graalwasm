# Notes

1. Try out support in Rust, implement the same wit interface in rust and compare against the C++ implementation.
2. Clarify how to find out whether the guest lang/module is compiled with wasm32 or wasm64.
3. Think of generating the statistics code. Try to find out the implicit assumptions made in the hand implementation.
