# Notes

## WIT

1. Check WIT C++, create a project.
2. Understand what the difference between guest and host is in WIT.
3. It would be good to be able to explain the component model and WIT to Fabio and Jens.
4. Check what WIT is enabling in this case. There are multiple languages, does WIT hide details about memory layout?
5. Try converting WIT to Java and Java to WIT.

## General remarks
1. Add methods for string reverse, concat.
2. Add a point class
3. Manually port the javascript binding to java.
4. Maybe try emitting wit from the wasm module.
