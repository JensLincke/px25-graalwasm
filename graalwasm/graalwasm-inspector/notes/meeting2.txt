Regarding the js wrapper file.

1. Strip everything that is not absolutely necessary! - done, now the js file is minimal.
2. It would be good to generate all this boilerplate code for java.
3. Maybe we can just skip all the js. Figure out what WebAssembly.instantiate is making possible.
4. Look if we can call webassembly directly?
5. Look whether there is something callable (call target) in WebAssembly
