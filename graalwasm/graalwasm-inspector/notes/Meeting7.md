# Notes

1. Feed the context from outside into the SimpleBinding.
2. Keep the utility functions private in SimpleBindings.
3. Work with lists of primitives as next step.
4. Add an average function, give list of integers from java and return a list of results (average, sum).

Write down lessons learned.

1. Recreating the function signature. 
2. Memory in Java to memory in wasm.
3. First high level, then under the hood.
4. Lessons learned along the way.
5. Describe interacting, the shortcomings of the primitive types (but you cant do anything meaningful with it).
